Effective CPU Utilization: 8.8% (3.503 out of 40 logical CPUs)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
 | utilization caused by load imbalance, threading runtime overhead, contended
 | synchronization, or thread/process underutilization. Explore sub-metrics to
 | estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP parallelism or run the Locks and
 | Waits analysis to identify parallel bottlenecks for other parallel runtimes.

    Total Thread Count: 4
     | The number of threads in the application is significantly lower than the
     | number of logical cores on the machine. Check if it is resulted by thread
     | number hard coding that limits application scalability.

    Spin and Overhead Time: 7.950s (11.5% of CPU Time)
     | When synchronization objects are used inside a parallel region, threads
     | can spend CPU time waiting on a lock release, contending with other
     | threads for a shared resource. Where possible, reduce synchronization by
     | using reduction or atomic operations, or minimize the amount of code
     | executed inside the critical section.
